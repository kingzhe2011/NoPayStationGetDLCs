# NoPayStationGetDLCs

A python script to download all DLCs for a specific game

## Usage

`python3 getdlc.py <GAMEID>`

## pkg2zip binary

This script requires a valid pkg2zip binary, the one here is a simple linux binary I got after running make.

If it does not work just compile it on your system from the official repository : https://github.com/mmozeiko/pkg2zip
